In this paper, we explore the 
              feasibility of a
medical training system for br
east tumor palpation based on 
                       haptic 
augmented reality (AR) technol
ogy. Haptic AR is an emerging 
research area in haptics and v
                irtual reality
      (VR), which is concerned
    with augmenting the haptic
properties of a real object by
       means of virtual haptic
feedback. The AR-based tumor p
               alpation system
consists of a real breast samp
                           le.
